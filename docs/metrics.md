We classify data quality issues into 7 Quality Metrics, with the following definitions:

| Quality Metric    | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMPLETENESS      | Refers to data that is incomplete or completely missing. For example, whether some text data is truncated or the content is empty.                                                      |
| EFFECTIVENESS     | Refers to whether the data is meaningful, suitable for a specific task, and conforms to the expected format or standard. For example, whether the text content contains garbled characters. |
| FLUENCY           | Refers to whether the data is fluent, grammatically correct, and can be read naturally. For example, whether  sentences conform to the grammatical rules.                               |
| RELEVANCE         | Refers to data that contains data that is irrelevant to the task. For example, some texts describe medical knowledge, but insert irrelevant advertising content.                        |
| SECURITY          | Refers to whether the data contains sensitive or private information and whether it conforms to the culture and values of various countries (the other party's values & our values).    |
| SIMILARITY        | Refers to whether the data content is repeated or there is very similar content.                                                                                                        |
| UNDERSTANDABILITY | Refers to whether the data is easy to understand and interpret. For example, whether the data is clear, unambiguous, and meaningful in context.                                         |
